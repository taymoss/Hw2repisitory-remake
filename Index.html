<h1>
Similarities Between the Two Learning Videos
</h1>
<p1>
	Everyone learns in different ways. Whether that way is by watching videos, or by getting one on one help everyone has their own way to learn new information. These videos present some new ways to learn and teach others to learn. One by a male and one by a female, and although their gender makes no difference in the information presented, they each had different ways of showing it. This made the ideas very interesting and intrigued me and pulled me in. Carol Dweck believes people should learn by using the growth method, and Derek Muller believes that people should learn by making mistakes and then learning the reason why they were wrong. In a way they are both right, but they both go about teaching in seperate ways.

<h2>
Similarities
</h2>
	<p2>
	First, both videos were sort of similar in that people need to learn from their mistakes, and that mistakes aren’t necessarily bad. Carol believes that the best way for people to learn is to make mistakes, and use basically constructive criticism to make it better. With the growth mindset people use it to increase how they learn based on their mistakes. Derek believes that people who get answers wrong are simply misinformed, and that they too can get taught the correct answer once they realize that it is wrong. Once somebody opens their mind to the information after they get an answer wrong, the idea tends to stick with people more, and they begin to value it a bit better.

<h3>
	Differences
  </h3>
  <p3>
Although they both have their similarities, they have some discrepancies as well. Carol studied a different set of people for her way of learning. For her way of learning she mostly focused on younger audience. She was focusing on school kids, for the majority of the kids they were younger, and still had malleable minds. For this reason it was easier to change their mindset and the way that they think. Even with this said it is still hard for them to change it because they are stubborn, but at the same time it is still manageable. 
Lastly, Derek focused on adults and the way that they might learn. He presents questions that he knows they may not know the answer to purposely, to expose their mind to able to receive the new information. This changes the way the adults think, and allows them to open up their mind to be able to receive the information. His job in my opinion is harder to do because he works with an older audience whose mind is already closed to any new form of receiving information.

<h4>
Conclusion
</h4>
<p4>
In conclusion, they both had their similarities in the fact that they want people to learn from their mistakes in order to receive new information. I think that I would benefit from this style of learning because I make a lot of mistakes, and the best way to learn is to find out why you’re wrong and try to fix it for the better. This would benefit me, as well as many others, and I would recommend it for the public to view or anyone willing to learn new ways to learn.
